  Building an NLP pipeline for English news classification. Fake news or real? News classification plays a pivotal role in content curation, personalization, and efficient news dissemination in today's digital media landscape. It helps users access relevant information quickly and enables media organizations to manage news effectily
  
- [Phishing email detection](https://github.com/cozzolinoac11/phishing-email-detection)
  
  Phishing email detection is the process of identifying and flagging potentially malicious emails that aim to deceive recipients into revealing sensitive information or taking harmful actions. Advanced email security solutions employ automated algorithms to rapidly identify phishing emails, reducing the risk of successful attacks.
Phishing email detection is a vital component of email security that employs various methods to identify and thwart phishing attempts, protecting users and organizations from falling victim to these deceptive tactics.
  
- [Face detection](https://github.com/cozzolinoac11/face-detection)

  Face detection is the process of detecting faces. 
  This is a fundamental computer vision task that involves locating and identifying human faces within images or video. It serves as the first step in many applications, such as facial recognition and     object tracking. 

  **What it does**: Face detection algorithms analyze visual data to locate and outline the positions of faces present in an image or video 

  **Applications**:
    - Facial Recognition: Identifying individuals based on their facial features.
    - Emotion Analysis: Analyzing facial expressions to determine emotions.
    - Security: Access control, surveillance, and identity verification.
    - Augmented Reality: Overlaying digital elements on real faces in real-time.
    - Automated Tagging: Organizing photos by detecting and tagging faces.

  Face detection is a critical technology in today's world, with numerous practical and innovative applications across various domains, from security to entertainment and beyond.

- [SeaOfFiles](https://github.com/cozzolinoac11/SeaOfFiles)

  SeaOfFiles allows the user to download one or more files from one of the connected storage hosts. To download the file, simply enter the name of the file and, if necessary, choose the host from which to download it. SeaOfFiles was developed using Python, Flask and Microsoft Azure.

- [City audio classification](https://github.com/cozzolinoac11/city_audio_classification)

  This project is a classification of audio of cities. This task is solved using some Jupyter Notebook, one for algorithm type. The algorithms used are AdaBoost, KNN, LeNet and SVM. In this folder there are the Jupyter Notebooks for algorithms and one Jupyter Notebook for audio acquisition and saving data as NumPy array.

- [Automotive Vehicles Engine Health](https://github.com/cozzolinoac11/automotive-vehicles-engine-health)

  #### Analyzing a Dataset on Automotive Engine Health for Predictive Maintenance and model building


  The dataset includes various vehicle engine health characteristics and measurements, such as engine speed, temperature, pressure and other sensor data.

  The objective of the project using this dataset is to build a predictive maintenance model for automotive engines. Investigating patterns and trends in the data, a machine learning model is trained      and built to predict when an engine is likely to require maintenance or repair. This could help vehicle owners and mechanics proactively address potential problems before they become more severe,        resulting in better vehicle performance and longer engine life.

  Once trained, the model could be integrated into a larger system for monitoring the health of automotive engines. For example, sensors could be installed in vehicles to collect real-time data on         engine performance, which could then be sent to a central server for analysis. The predictive maintenance model could then generate alerts or recommendations for maintenance or repair.

- [Keyword Extractor](https://github.com/cozzolinoac11/keywordExtractor)

  What Is Keyword Extraction? Keyword extraction (also known as keyword detection or keyword analysis) is a text analysis technique that automatically extracts the most used and most important words and expressions from a text. It helps summarize the content of texts and recognize the main topics discussed. Every day, internet users create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. Social media comments, product reviews, emails, blog posts, searches, chats, etc. We have all sorts of unstructured textual data. The question is how to sort through this chaos to find what is relevant. Keyword mining can help you extract the most important keywords or phrases from a given text without having to read a single line. Whether it's a product manager trying to analyze a stack of product reviews, a customer service manager analyzing customer interactions, or a researcher sifting through hundreds of online documents on a specific topic, you can use keyword mining to easily understand the content of a text. With keyword extraction, teams can be more efficient and harness the power of data. You can say goodbye to manual and repetitive tasks (saving countless man-hours) and access valuable information that will help you turn unstructured data into valuable knowledge.

- [Wildfire Prediction Dataset (Satellite Images)](https://github.com/cozzolinoac11/wildfire_prediction)

  #### Satellite images of areas that previously experienced wildfires in Canada

  ### About Dataset
  #### Source
  Refer to Canada's website for the original wildfires data:
  Forest Fires - Open Government Portal
  Original license for the data:
  Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution (CC-BY) license â€“ Quebec

  #### About Dataset
  This dataset contains satellite images (350x350px) in 2 classes :
    - Wildfire : 22710 images
    - No wildfire : 20140 images
  
  #### How
  Using Longitude and Latitude coordinates for each wildfire spot (> 0.01 acres burned) found on the dataset above we extracted satellite images of those areas using MapBox API to create a more convenient format of the dataset for deep learning and building a model that can predict whether an area is at risk of a wildfire or not
